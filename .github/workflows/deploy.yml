# This is handled automatically by Vercel's GitHub integration
# When you connect your GitHub repo to Vercel:
# - Pushes to main → production deployment
# - Pushes to other branches → preview deployment
# - Pull requests → preview deployment with comment

# If you want additional CI checks before deployment, uncomment below:
